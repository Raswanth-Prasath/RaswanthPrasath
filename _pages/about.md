I'm a Transportation Engineering graduate student at
[Arizona State University (ASU)](https://www.asu.edu/), combining technical
expertise in GIS and transportation engineering with a passion for creative design.
I'm working as a Research Assistant at ASU's School of Earth and Space
Exploration.

I received my Bachelor in Civil Engineering from
[National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli (NIT-T)](https://www.nitt.edu/)
in 2023. I previously held a research position at
Centre of Excellence for Road Safety (CoERS).
I'm interested in exploring the potential of AI in Transportation.
